This repo contains all the completed programming assignments and slides over the weeks. If you're looking for solutions here, 
I recommend you to go through the exercises by yourself. Use the discussion forums if you have to. I found the forums very responsive.

Here is a list of topics discussed in each assignment (shown next to each week):

Week 1: No assignments on this week.
        Programming assignments start from week-2.
Week 2: Linear regression with one and multiple variables (ex1 and ex1_multi).
Week 3: Logistic regression (ex2 and ex2_reg).
Week 4: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks (ex3 and ex3_nn).
Week 5: Neural Network Learning - Backpropagation (ex4).
Week 6: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance (ex5).
Week 7: Support Vector Machines - SVM (ex6 and ex6_spam).
Week 8: K-Means Clustering and PCA (ex7 and ex7_pca).
Week 9: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems (ex8 and ex8_cofi). This is the final assignment.
